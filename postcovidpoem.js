//Post covid poem

"Post covid"
"Most noted"
"Dust coated"
"Boat Loaded"
"Most vivid"
"Most social"
"Most noble" 
"Most local"
"Im bleeding"
"Miss leading" 
"Need feeding"
"Not worth it"
"God worship"
"NoDoor"
"No behavior"
"No permit"
"Throat cutting"
"Quiet Trusting"
"Back slashing"
"Tax lasting"
"Half laughing"
"Shape shifting"
"Slow drifting"
"Surpassing"
